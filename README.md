# 🚀 React Native Dev Guide – Git Workflow, Expo & EAS (Ultimate Version)

> A clear, structured, and professional guide to help you (and your team) adopt the right workflow, master project organization, and ship confidently with React Native.

## 💡 Why This Guide Exists

I originally came from **Vanilla JavaScript / DOM and Lua**, then transitioned to **TypeScript**. Recently, I started learning how to build real **mobile apps with React Native and Expo**.

Most of my past projects were **solo**, so I never had to master Git and collaboration workflows like in a real team or company. As I learned, I began collecting the key elements I kept using and searching for: Git commands, commit conventions, folder structures, React hooks, and build workflows.

Sure, there are plenty of guides online, but this one is the **guide I wish I had found**. It gathers the most useful concepts and practices in one place, without having to dig through scattered tutorials or outdated docs.

If you're self-taught or transitioning to React Native, this is for you. It's a **pocket guide** meant to help you understand 90% of what makes a clean, professional project structure. Hopefully, it helps you the same way writing it helped me.
